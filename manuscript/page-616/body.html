So you think...</p><p>The door closed behind the outgoer.</p><p>Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.</p><p>A vestal's lamp.</p><p>Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.</p><p>Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.
