The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi!</p><p>THE MOTHER: (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.</p><p>STEPHEN: (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? No. What bogeyman's trick is this?</p><p>BUCK MULLIGAN: (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it!
