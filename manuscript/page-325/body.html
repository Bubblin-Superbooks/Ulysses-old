But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.</p><p>—How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't seen you for a month of Sundays.</p><p>—Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?</p></div> </div>
