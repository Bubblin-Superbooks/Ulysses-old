He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)</p><p>MYLES CRAWFORD: (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arsewipe here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes?

He carries a large portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)</p><p>BEAUFOY: (Drawls.) No, you aren't. Not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct.</p></div> </div>
