That's good news.</p><p>He moved to go.</p><p>—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.</p><p>—Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>—Tell you what, M'Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral, will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found. </p><p>—I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all right.</p><p>—Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M'Coy will do.</p></div> </div>
