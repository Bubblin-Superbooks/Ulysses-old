The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion. </p><p> A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggers in Hamlet. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. </p><p>—How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.</p><p>—Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.</p><p>The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to trundle.</p></div> </div>
