His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.</p><p>Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.</p><p>Nones.
