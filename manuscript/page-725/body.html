<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p></p><p>A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.</p><p>—Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.</p><p>The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.</p><p>—You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.</p><p>The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John Long's. Slaking his drouth.</p></div> </div>
