<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. </p><p> A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. </p><p> Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that.. Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. </p></div> </div>
