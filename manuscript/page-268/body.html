Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.</p><p>They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder. The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about it. Man's head found in a garden. </p></div> </div>
