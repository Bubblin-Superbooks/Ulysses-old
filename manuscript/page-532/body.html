Looking up from the back garden. Terrific explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time. </p><p>Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there some first Saturday of the month.
