Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim.

With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.</p><p>Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.</p><p>He turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds. Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.</p></div> </div>
