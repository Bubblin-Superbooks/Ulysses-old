Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.</p><p>THE WATERFALL:</p><p>Phillaphulla Poulaphouca Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.</p><p>THE YEWS: Ssh! Sister, speak!</p><p>THE NYMPH: (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and hugewinged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilla convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.</p></div> </div>
