Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change: that's all. Lovers: yum yum.</p><p>Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. </p><p> Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want.
