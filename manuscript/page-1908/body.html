Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.</p><p>VOICES: (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.</p><p>(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses.

Sister. Our sister. Ssh!</p></div> </div>
