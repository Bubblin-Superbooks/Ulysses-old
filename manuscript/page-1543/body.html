<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)</p><p>THE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.</p><p>BLOOM: My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go√ªt. He might be mad. Dogdays. Uncertain in his movements.</p></div> </div>
