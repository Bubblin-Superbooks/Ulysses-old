Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brainwork. Years and years I loved you, O, my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.</p><p>ZOE: (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!</p><p>FLORRY: (Points to Stephen.) Look! He's white.</p><p>BLOOM: (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.</p><p>THE MOTHER: (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!</p><p>STEPHEN: (Panting.) His noncorrosive sublimate! The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones.</p><p>THE MOTHER: (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched finger.) Beware God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)</p></div> </div>
