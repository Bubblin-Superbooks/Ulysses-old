Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my head. Prr.</p><p>Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.</p><p>—Milk for the pussens, he said.</p><p>—Mrkgnao! the cat cried.</p><p>They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.
