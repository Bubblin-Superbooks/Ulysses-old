Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.</p><p>A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.</p><p>They followed.</p><p>Offend me still. Speak on.</p><p>Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.</p><p>Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.</p><p>Laud we the gods And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our bless'd altars.</p></div> </div>
