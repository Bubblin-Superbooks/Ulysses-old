Rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. </p><p>THE CALLS: Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.</p><p>THE ANSWERS: Round behind the stable.</p><p>(A deafmute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children 's hands imprisons him.)</p><p>THE CHILDREN: Kithogue! Salute!</p><p>THE IDIOT: (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.)
