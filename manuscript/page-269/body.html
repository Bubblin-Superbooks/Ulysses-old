Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning.

Drunk about the place and capering with Martin's umbrella.</p><p>And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.</p></div> </div>
