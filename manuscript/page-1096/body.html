<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p></p><p>In Gerard's rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.</p><p>Done anyhow. Postal order, stamp. Postoffice lower down. Walk now. Enough. Barney Kiernan's I promised to meet them. Dislike that job. House of mourning. Walk. Pat! Doesn't hear. Deaf beetle he is.</p><p>Car near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins. Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Paint face behind on him then he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep my mind off.</p></div> </div>
