Haroun Al Raschid.</p><p>BELLO: (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas√© man about town. </p><p>BLOOM: (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now!</p><p>BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here?
