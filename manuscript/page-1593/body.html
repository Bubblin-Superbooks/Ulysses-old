We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.</p><p>(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria.
