<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Looking for trouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now he's in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.</p><p>—Up the Boers!</p><p>—Three cheers for De Wet!</p><p>—We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.</p><p>Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill. The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows used to. Whether on the scaffold high.</p></div> </div>
