Give up the moody brooding.</p><p>His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead:</p><p>And no more turn aside and brood Upon love's bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.</p><p>Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.
