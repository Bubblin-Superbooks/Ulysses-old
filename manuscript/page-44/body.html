<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour. </p><p>—It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.</p><p>—Taste it, sir, she said.</p><p>He drank at her bidding.</p><p>—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits.</p></div> </div>
