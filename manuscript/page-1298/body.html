<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A plate crashes: a woman screams: a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. </p><p>CISSY CAFFREY:</p><p>I gave it to Molly Because she was jolly, The leg of the duck, The leg of the duck.</p><p>(Private Carr and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)</p><p>THE VIRAGO: Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.</p></div> </div>
