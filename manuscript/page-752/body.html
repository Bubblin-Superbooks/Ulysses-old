<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:</p><p>—Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.</p><p>Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.</p><p>—What are you doing here, Stephen?</p></div> </div>
