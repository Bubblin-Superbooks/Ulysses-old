I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.</p><p>—Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.</p><p>—No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.</p><p>So he calls the old dog over.</p><p>—What's on you, Garry? says he.</p><p>Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.
