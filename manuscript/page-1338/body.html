He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eye flashes bloodshot. Half of one ear, all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)</p><p>PADDY DIGNAM: (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.</p><p>(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)</p><p>BLOOM: (In triumph.) You hear?</p><p>PADDY DIGNAM: Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!</p></div> </div>
