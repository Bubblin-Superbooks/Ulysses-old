<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Would you do what he did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. Nat√ºrlich, put there for you. Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden's rock. They are waiting for him now. </p><p> The truth, spit it out. I would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water cold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't see! Who's behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. </p><p> I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death. I.. With him together down.. I could not save her. Waters: bitter death: lost. </p></div> </div>
