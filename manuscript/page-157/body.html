<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands. </p><p>The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.</p><p>—Now, my miss, he said.</p><p>She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.</p><p>—Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you, please?</p><p>Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. </p></div> </div>
