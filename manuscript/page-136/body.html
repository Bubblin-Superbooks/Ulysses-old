Darkness is in our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more. </p><p>She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.

The virgin at Hodges Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write. </p><p> Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.</p></div> </div>
