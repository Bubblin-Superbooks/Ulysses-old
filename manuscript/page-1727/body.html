<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>BELLA: You'll know me the next time.</p><p>BLOOM: (Composed, regards her.) Pass√©e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Long in the tooth and superfluous hair. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.</p><p>BELLA: (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fbhracht!</p><p>BLOOM: (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, your bully's cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.</p></div> </div>
