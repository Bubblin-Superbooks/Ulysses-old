There's a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if I'm not there, will you?</p><p>—I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all right.</p><p>—Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M'Coy will do.</p><p>—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.</p></div> </div>
