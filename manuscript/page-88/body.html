These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.</p><p>He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.</p><p>—Three twelve, he said. I think you'll find that's right.</p><p>—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.</p><p>—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.</p><p>Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.</p></div> </div>
