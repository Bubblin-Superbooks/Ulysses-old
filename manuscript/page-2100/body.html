"Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again." "I can't come back and I won't come back Without my schoolfellows all. For if my master he did hear He'd make it a sorry ball." She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call. She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head. And now he'll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.</p></div> </div>
