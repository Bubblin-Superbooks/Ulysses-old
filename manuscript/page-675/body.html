<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.</p><p>In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.</p><p>—What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p><p>Am I a father? If I were?</p><p>Shrunken uncertain hand.</p><p>—Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him.</p></div> </div>
