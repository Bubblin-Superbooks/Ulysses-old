<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.</p><p>Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.</p><p>And no more turn aside and brood.</p><p>Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's shirts.</p><p>In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.</p></div> </div>
