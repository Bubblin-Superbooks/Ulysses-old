Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.</p><p>CISSY CAFFREY: (To the crowd.) No, I was with the privates.</p><p>STEPHEN: (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...</p><p>PRIVATE CARR: (His cap awry, advances to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?</p><p>STEPHEN: (Looks up to the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of selfpretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand.) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin ce sont vos oignons.(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it precisely?</p></div> </div>
