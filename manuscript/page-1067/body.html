Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:</p><p>—Could you make a hole in another pint?</p><p>—Could a swim duck? says I.</p><p>—Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.</p><p>—Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house.
