<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>BLOOM: (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Manfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.</p><p>THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.</p><p>BLOOM: (Crosslacing.) Too tight?</p><p>THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.</p><p>BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!</p></div> </div>
