The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. </p><p> In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. </p></div> </div>
