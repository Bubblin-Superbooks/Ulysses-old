<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Are you condemned to do this?</p><p>—They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.</p><p>In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.</p><p>—What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p></div> </div>
