<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Hygiene that was what they call now. </p><p> Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. </p><p>—Have you a cheese sandwich?</p><p>—Yes, sir.</p><p>Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber, Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. </p><p>—Wife well?</p><p>—Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?</p></div> </div>
