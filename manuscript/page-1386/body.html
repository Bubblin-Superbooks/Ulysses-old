Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.</p><p>ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.</p><p>(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. </p><p>KITTY: (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!</p><p>ZOE: (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.</p><p>(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled catterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.</p></div> </div>
