<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> De mortuis nil nisi prius. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.</p><p>—How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.</p><p>—Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.</p><p>The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.</p><p>Burying him. We come to bury Cæsar. His ides of March or June. He doesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd give a trifle to know who he is.</p></div> </div>
