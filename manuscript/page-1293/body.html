Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.</p><p>BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.)

Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)</p></div> </div>
