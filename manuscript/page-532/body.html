His eyes said:</p><p>—Not here. Don't see him.</p><p>Out. I hate dirty eaters.</p><p>He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne's. Stopgap. Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.</p><p>—Roast and mashed here.</p><p>—Pint of stout.</p><p>Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.</p></div> </div>
